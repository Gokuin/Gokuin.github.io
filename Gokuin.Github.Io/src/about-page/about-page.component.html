      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I started my career in Software Engineering with an internship in C# during highschool. Since then programming has shifted into more of backend Java development for my day to day job. In my free time when I get the programming itch I do enjoy being able to seek insights into data using ML and AI.
          My experiences range from Web development to back end development to data science to sometimes ML. I would like to get into game development at some point if possible.</p>
